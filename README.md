//this JavaScript code that simulates minting and listing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with different attributes for bears: its based on the function will take in some values as parameters and store it in the variable 

1. **`const NFTs = [];`**: This initializes an array called `NFTs` to store the minted NFTs.

2. **`function mintNFT(_bear_name, _bear_hat, _bear_shirt, _bear_beard)`**: This function is used to mint (create) a new NFT and add it to the `NFTs` array. It takes four parameters representing the bear's name, hat, shirt, and beard.

   Inside the function:
   - The provided bear attributes are capitalized by using the `[0].toUpperCase() + _bear_name.slice(1)` approach.
   - A new NFT object is created with the provided attributes and added to the `NFTs` array.
   - A log message is printed indicating the successful minting of the bear.

3. **`function listNFTs()`**: This function iterates through the `NFTs` array and prints the metadata of each NFT to the console.

   Inside the function:
   - It loops through each NFT in the `NFTs` array.
   - For each NFT, it prints the ID, bear name, bear hat, bear shirt, and bear beard.

4. **Calling the Functions**:
   - Three NFTs are minted using the `mintNFT` function with different bear attributes.
   - After minting, the `listNFTs` function is called to display the metadata of all minted NFTs.

5. **`getTotalSupply()`**: This function seems to be commented out in your code. It would have printed the total number of minted NFTs to the console.

**NFT Bear Minting System**

This JavaScript code defines a simple NFT bear minting system. It allows you to create NFTs representing bears with different attributes, such as name, hat, shirt, and beard. The minted NFTs are stored in an array for later retrieval and display.

**Usage**

1. Include the provided JavaScript code in your project.

2. **Minting NFTs**: Use the `mintNFT` function to mint new NFTs. Pass in the bear's name, hat, shirt, and beard as arguments.

3. **Listing NFTs**: Call the `listNFTs` function to display the metadata of all minted NFTs.

4. **Total Supply (Optional)**: You can uncomment and use the `getTotalSupply` function to print the total number of minted NFTs.

Feel free to customize this code according to your needs and integrate it into your NFT project.
